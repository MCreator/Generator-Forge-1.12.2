# MCreator generator for Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 mods
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Pylo/MCreatorGenerator-Forge-1.12.2/blob/master/LICENSE)

**WARNING: Minecraft 1.12.2 is no longer supported. This repository here is only for reference purposes
and for community use. It is not officially supported.**

This plugin in its current state is compatible with MCreator 2020.2. Further work on this plugin 
would be needed to support this plugin in MCreator 2020.3.

This plugin is intended for generator plugin developers to offer name mappings to work from and offer
examples on how to use Freemarker mechanics and to see what data is available in the templates. Existing
generators were not really useful in this due to their licensing. This generator is therefore released under
Apache 2.0 license.
