## For MCreator 2020.5

This branch is designed to make 1.12.2 generator compatible with 2020.5 version of MCreator. Check branches for specific versions.

This version should load in 2020.5, but will not support all features and might break things.

## How to install

Please check https://mcreator.net/wiki/developing-mcreator-plugins#wiki-index-6 for installation guide.

## Info

**WARNING: Minecraft 1.12.2 is no longer supported by MCreator (Pylo). This repository here is only for reference purposes
and for community use. It is not officially supported.**

This plugin is intended for generator plugin developers to offer name mappings to work from and offer
examples on how to use Freemarker mechanics and to see what data is available in the templates. Existing
generators were not really useful in this due to their licensing. This generator is therefore released under
Apache 2.0 license.

MCreator is a trademark of Pylo. 

Other components of MCreator are licensed under other licenses, this license only applies to the files in this repository.

You are welcome to support this project by opening pull requests.

Before we can use your code, you must sign the [MCreator CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/MCreator/Generator-Forge-1.12.2), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and we approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.
